In this ongoing project, I track my nutrition intake of the different foodgroups recommended by "the Daily Dozen" of Dr. Greger. 

I have cleaned the data, done a first EDA and answered a first few questions such as: 
  - How does the intake of a single foodgroup evolve over time (percentage-wise)?
  - What is the influence of day of week on single foodgroup intake?

To answer these initial quetions, I have created a few functions that allow for input, depending on which foodgroop is of interest. 

A few notes: 
- I have chosen to work with percentages, as to normalise the data.
- If the recommended daily servings is 3 for a foodgroup, 3 is the max that can be recorded. This makes sense, as the idea is to get as many different nutitional compenents in a day as possible. This also means, however, that the tracked data is not a complete picture of the consumed foods per day. Rather, it shows how the food consumptions performs against the benchmarks as defined by the Daily Dozen.
- Given that there is only a few months' of data currently, any result is very preliminary. On a personal level though, some conclusions can already be drawn.
